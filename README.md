# sublet
<br>revolutionary installment
<br>
<br>ever wanted to install some ass app?
<br>whether it uses a flatpak, a appimage, or a .deb or .rpm, we'll install it.
<br>
<br>needed to compile for source?
<br>we got ya

<br>plus our own app store
<br>and new .sublet technology

# sublet app store is being prioritized
compiling from source, .sublet, and flatpak/appimage/deb/rpm shit will be delayed up

# where to download
~~Go to the Releases page for stable release.~~
<br>stable releases don't exist up
<br>~~go to github actions for latest build~~
<br> those broke
<br> ~~compile up the C# and replicate what the shell script does~~
<br> i'll be testing with github codespaces (I have no linux devices as of now)
<br> download source, run build.sh
<br> you might get some crap about replaccing files, say yes
<br> then run sublet-install.sh

# sublet overhaul
sublet is in a major overhaul
<br>hopefully done by Sunday (tommorow as of writing this)
<br>a lot is gonna be done up, it'll be great
<br>also coolnew things like legacy version and core version, coming soon
<br>gui version of sublet too, it'll prolly be dogshit but still,
<br>star up

# sublet core "versions"
there's gonna be 2 sublet Cores
<br>sublet core and subcore
<br>the difference is that one is just very minimal sublet (subcore) and one is extremely limited (core)

# there's also planned
sublet-gui
<br>written in java (or maybe c# just to make it easier for me to compile)
