# sublet
<br>revolutionary installment
<br>
<br>ever wanted to install some ass app?
<br>whether it uses a flatpak, a appimage, or a .deb or .rpm, we'll install it.
<br>
<br>needed to compile for source?
<br>we got ya

<br>plus our own app store
<br>and new .sublet technology

# sublet app store is being prioritized
compiling from source, .sublet, and flatpak/appimage/deb/rpm shit will be delayed up

# where to download
~~Go to the Releases page for stable release.~~
<br>stable releases don't exist up
<br>~~go to github actions for latest build~~
<br> those broke
<br> compile up the C# and replicate what the shell script does
<br> i'll be testing with github codespaces (I have no linux devices as of now)

# sublet overhaul
sublet is in a major overhaul
<br>hopefully done by Sunday (tommorow as of writing this)
<br>a lot is gonna be done up, it'll be great
<br>also coolnew things like legacy version and core version, coming soon
<br>star up
